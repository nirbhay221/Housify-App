Motivation/Purpose
Mooreâ€™s Vision:
For college students seeking housing solutions and efficient expense management, Housify connects users with compatible roommates, ideal living spaces, and facilitates seamless bill-splitting.
Unlike other housing platforms, Housify uniquely combines a robust roommate finder, apartment listings, and integrated expense management features.

User Stories - Role Play
As a college student/working professional, I want to access basic functionalities like apartment listings, sublets, and available rooms to find suitable housing within close proximity to the university or workplace.
As a formed roommate group, I want to manage shared expenses, chores distribution, and basic arrangements within the app for a streamlined and harmonious living situation.
As a user seeking accommodation or a roommate, I want to communicate via a chat-based integration within the app to simplify interaction and negotiation.

Roadblocks/Surprises/Workarounds
TomTom API implementation challenges due to limited documentation on functionalities like zooming and global map setting.
Chat fragment unable to receive messages and update in real-time after sending a message.
Navigation between fragments and activities hosting different fragments posed challenges.
What would you do differently?
Start with the option of posting multiple images first when adding a property.
Focus more on the validation of possible spam properties.
Put slightly more emphasis on the app's UI, especially for the Roommates tab.

Future Work - Nice-to-Haves
Access to a supportive community forum within the app for users feeling overwhelmed by rent agreement complexities.
Integration of a convenient rent pay portal within the app.
Access to furniture and utility services like IKEA or Wayfair for convenient furnishing through the app.
